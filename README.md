# Models-of-Physiological-Systems
Various MATLAB and Simulink representations of Analogous models of Physiological Systems.

## First Model: Hodgkin - Huxley Single Neuron Model:

This model uses MATLAB sub-functions, which are exported to the Simulink environment in order to achieve the behaviour of the Extracellular Potential of the Cell Membrane which was proposed by Hodgkin, and Huxley.
